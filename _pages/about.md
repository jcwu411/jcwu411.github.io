I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Physical oceanography from the School of Physics, Peking University advised by Prof. Yonggang Liu, and I expect to graduate in the summer of 2025. Although my doctoral project is Snowball Earth, I am currently interested in the dynamics of the upper ocean and submesoscale processes.

I received my B.Sc. in Atmospheric Sciences from School of Physics, Peking University in July 2020. I was fortunate and honored to have opportunities to work with many distinguished professors during my undergraduate years. Prof. Yongyun Hu  and Prof. Yongyun Hu in Peking University and other valued friends taught me specific knowledge and skills and let me enjoy the fun of scientific research.
